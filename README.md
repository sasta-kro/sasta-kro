## Hey, I'm Sai Aike
But people call me Sasta or Crow.

CS undergrad. I spend most of my time below the application layer.
Started with Android/Kotlin, got more interested in what ran underneath it, and kept going down.
Now I manage headless Linux servers, write Go tooling, and am building a self-hosted PaaS from scratch.

### What I'm building now

**`paas-project` (private for now)** - lightweight self-hosted PaaS in Go.
Push code, get a running container. Traefik reverse proxy, automatic TLS, Prometheus/Grafana observability.
Building it to understand what Netlify, Heroku, and Render actually do under the hood.
