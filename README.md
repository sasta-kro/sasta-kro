## Hey, I'm Sai Aike
People call me Sasta or Crow.

CS undergrad. I like spending most of my time below the application layer, or looking at the broader infrastructure.
Started with Android/Kotlin, got interested in what ran underneath it, and kept going down.
Now I manage headless Linux servers, write Go tooling, backend systems, and am building [Corvus](https://github.com/sasta-kro/corvus), a self-hosted PaaS in Go. I also do automation tools in Python. 

The pinned repos below are worth a look.
