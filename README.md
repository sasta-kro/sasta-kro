## Hey, I'm Sai Aike
People call me Sasta or Crow.

CS undergrad. I'm really into the infrstructure side of software, like platform engineering and DevOps. I also like building things and making apps like backend systems. I started off with Android/Kotlin, then got interested in what ran underneath software, and kept going down.  
Now I manage headless Linux servers, write Go tooling, backend systems, and am building [Corvus](https://github.com/sasta-kro/corvus), a self-hosted PaaS in Go. 

The pinned repos below are worth a look.
